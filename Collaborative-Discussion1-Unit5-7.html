                    <p>This formative discussion lasted for <strong>3 weeks covering units 5, 6 and 7</strong>. The activity required redesigning a complex statistical table from an academic paper and presenting findings through improved visualizations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Discussion Topic:</h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p>Imagine you have submitted a paper for publication (see Brown, 1994). The editor has returned his comments saying that he is willing to accept the paper for publication on condition that <strong>Table 2</strong> is changed. He feels that <em>'it is difficult for the reader to understand, contains too much information and is too large.'</em></p>
                        
                        <p>You now have to redo Table 2 and present some of the findings using plots and present your results in the forum. Reflect also upon your experiences of undertaking this task and what you have learnt. Share these reflections with your fellow students (no more than 500 words).</p>

                    <h3>Redesigning Table 2 from Brown (1994) – Prioritizing Clarity for Clinical Decision-Making</h3>

                    <h4>Understanding the Challenge</h4>
                    <p>After reviewing Brown's (1994) original Table 2, I understood the editor's concerns immediately. The table presented responses from 550 GPs across 24 statements about intrapartum care provision, creating a dense matrix that obscured rather than revealed key insights. My redesign focuses on organizing information by priority levels to support evidence-based decision-making.</p>

                    <h4>Redesigned Table 2</h4>
                    <div class="box">
                        <span class="image fit">
                            <img src="images/NumericalAnalysis/redesigned_table2.png" alt="Redesigned Table 2: GP Attitudes Toward Intrapartum Care" />
                        </span>
                        <p><em>Figure 1: Redesigned Table 2 organized by priority levels (Critical Barriers, Moderate Concerns, Development Needs) with practical implications.</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I reorganized the data into three distinct priority categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Critical Barriers</strong> (>70% agreement) – Issues requiring immediate intervention</li>
                        <li><strong>Moderate Concerns</strong> (50-70% agreement) – Areas needing strategic planning</li>
                        <li><strong>Development Needs</strong> (<40% agreement) – Training and support gaps</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This structure immediately shows where GPs have strongest consensus and where policy interventions would have greatest impact. Each row now includes practical implications, transforming raw statistics into actionable insights (Knaflic, 2015).</p>

                    <h4>Visual Presentations</h4>
                    
                    <h5>Figure 1: Top 5 Barriers to GP Intrapartum Care Provision</h5>
                    <div class="box">
                        <span class="image fit">
                            <img src="images/NumericalAnalysis/figure1_barriers.png" alt="Top 5 Barriers to GP Intrapartum Care" />
                        </span>
                        <p><em>Horizontal bar chart ranking the most significant barriers by agreement level, using color coding to indicate severity.</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This horizontal bar chart ranks the most significant barriers by agreement level, using colour coding to indicate severity. The visual hierarchy makes it instantly clear that workload pressures (83%) and role clarity with obstetricians (78%) are the most critical issues requiring immediate attention.</p>

                    <h5>Figure 2: Training and Support Gaps</h5>
                    <div class="box">
                        <span class="image fit">
                            <img src="images/NumericalAnalysis/figure2_gaps.png" alt="Training and Support Gaps" />
                        </span>
                        <p><em>Comparison chart revealing the disconnect between willingness to provide care and perceived preparedness.</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This comparison reveals a striking disconnect: while 65-75% of GPs express willingness to provide various aspects of intrapartum care, only 25-56% feel adequately prepared or supported. The gaps (marked in red) highlight where training investment is most urgently needed—particularly in clinical competence confidence (50% gap).</p>

                    <h4>Reflection on the Redesign Process</h4>
                    <p>This exercise fundamentally changed how I think about statistical presentation. Initially, I wanted to preserve all 24 data points from the original table, but I realized this would recreate the exact problem the editor identified. Following Tufte's (2001) principle that "tables should reveal, not conceal," I prioritized information by decision-making utility rather than comprehensive data retention.</p>

                    <p>The most challenging aspect was deciding what to exclude. I struggled with removing the full Likert-scale breakdown (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree), ultimately choosing clarity over completeness. For busy clinicians and policymakers, the agreement percentages tell the essential story (Few, 2012). Detailed distributions could remain in supplementary materials if needed for meta-analysis.</p>

                    <p>Creating the visualizations revealed patterns invisible in the original format. Figure 2 particularly exposed a critical insight: many GPs are willing to provide intrapartum care, but most feel inadequately prepared. This suggests we need dual strategies—reducing systemic barriers like workload while simultaneously investing in professional development (Greenhalgh, 2010).</p>

                    <p>What surprised me most was how reorganization changed my own understanding. When everything was listed equally in the original table, it wasn't obvious that workload pressures and training deficits represent fundamentally different problems requiring different solutions. One needs system resources, the other needs educational investment.</p>

                    <p>This task reinforced that presenting statistical analysis to diverse audiences requires balancing technical accuracy with practical accessibility. Numbers only drive decisions when communicated clearly. I'm interested to hear how others approached this challenge—particularly whether you chose similar prioritization strategies or took different approaches to simplification.</p>

                    <h3>1. Simplification Through Prioritization</h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p><strong>What I Found:</strong> The original Table 2 contained 24 different barrier statements with full Likert-scale responses, making it overwhelming for readers to identify which issues mattered most.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What This Means:</h4>
                        <p>By organizing barriers into three priority levels based on agreement percentages, I created a decision-making framework. Critical barriers (>70% agreement) demand immediate action, moderate concerns (50-70%) need strategic planning, and development needs (<40%) indicate training gaps. This approach transforms descriptive statistics into prescriptive action points.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>2. Visual Hierarchy Reveals Hidden Patterns</h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p><strong>What I Found:</strong> The horizontal bar chart immediately shows that workload pressures (83%) and role clarity (78%) dominate GP concerns, while the training gaps chart reveals a 50% disconnect between willingness and confidence.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What This Means:</h4>
                        <p>These visualizations expose two distinct problem types: systemic issues (workload, medico-legal concerns) requiring policy changes, and competence issues requiring educational investment. The original table format masked this crucial distinction by presenting all 24 statements as equally weighted items.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>3. Practical Implications Column Enhances Utility</h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p><strong>What I Found:</strong> Adding a "Practical Implication" column to each priority level translates percentages into actionable recommendations (e.g., "Immediate workforce planning needed" for 83% workload concerns).</p>
                        
                        <h4>What This Means:</h4>
                        <p>Statistical results become meaningless without interpretation. Healthcare administrators need to know what the numbers mean for resource allocation, not just what percentage of GPs agree with a statement. This bridges the gap between statistical analysis and decision-making (Greenhalgh, 2010).</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>4. Color Coding for Cognitive Ease</h3>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p><strong>What I Found:</strong> Using color categories (red for critical, orange for high, blue for moderate, green for low) in both the table and charts creates consistent visual language.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What This Means:</h4>
                        <p>Color coding reduces cognitive load by allowing readers to instantly categorize information without reading every number (Few, 2012). This design principle is especially important for busy clinicians who need to extract key insights quickly.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>This redesign taught me several principles:</p>

                            <li><strong>Less is more:</strong> Removing secondary information actually increased clarity and impact</li>
                            <li><strong>Hierarchy matters:</strong> Not all data points deserve equal visual weight</li>
                            <li><strong>Context is crucial:</strong> Raw percentages need interpretation for non-statisticians</li>
                            <li><strong>Visualization reveals:</strong> Patterns invisible in tables become obvious in charts</li>

                    <p>This collaborative discussion fundamentally changed my approach to presenting statistical analysis. Before this exercise, I viewed comprehensive data presentation as a virtue—the more information included, the better. The editor's feedback on Brown's (1994) Table 2 challenged this assumption, forcing me to recognize that overwhelming readers with data can be as problematic as providing too little.</p>
                    
                    <p>The redesign process was intellectually demanding in unexpected ways. Deciding what to exclude felt uncomfortable initially, as if I was compromising scientific rigor. However, I learned that thoughtful simplification actually enhances rigor by helping readers focus on statistically significant patterns rather than drowning in noise. Tufte's (2001) concept of "data-ink ratio"—maximizing information conveyed per visual element—became my guiding principle.</p>
                    
                    <p>Creating the visualizations revealed insights I'd missed when reviewing the original table. The training gaps chart (Figure 2) particularly struck me—the 50% gap between willingness to provide care and confidence in doing so was buried in the original format but jumped out visually. This experience demonstrated that visualization isn't just about making data "prettier"; it's a analytical tool that can reveal relationships and patterns invisible in tabular form (Few, 2012).</p>
                    
                    <p>The peer discussion aspect enriched my learning significantly. Seeing how classmates approached the same redesign challenge from different angles—some choosing entirely different chart types, others prioritizing different subsets of data—illustrated that effective communication has multiple valid solutions. Some peers focused on temporal trends I'd overlooked; others created interactive elements I hadn't considered. This exposure to alternative approaches expanded my toolkit for future data presentation challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most valuable was learning to write the "Practical Implications" column. Translating percentages into action items forced me to think beyond descriptive statistics toward prescriptive recommendations. For example, rather than just noting that 83% of GPs reported workload pressures, I specified "Immediate workforce planning needed." This shift from reporting to recommending is crucial for translating research into practice (Greenhalgh, 2010).</p>
                    
                    <p>The exercise also highlighted the importance of knowing your audience. My redesign prioritized accessibility for healthcare administrators and policymakers who need quick decision-making insights, not statisticians who want granular distributions. This audience-first thinking will be essential in my future work, whether presenting machine learning results to business stakeholders or explaining AI system performance to non-technical users.</p>
                    
                    <p>One unexpected challenge was maintaining academic credibility while simplifying. I worried that removing the detailed Likert breakdowns might appear to be "dumbing down" the research. However, feedback from peers and reflection on the learning outcomes helped me recognize that accessibility and rigor are complementary, not contradictory. The key is ensuring that simplified presentations are backed by complete analysis available for those who want deeper details—hence my decision to note that full distributions could be in supplementary materials.</p>
                    
                    <p>This discussion also taught me about the iterative nature of good communication. My first draft of the redesigned table still felt cluttered. Only after multiple revisions did I achieve the clarity I was seeking. This aligns with writing advice that applies equally to data presentation: good communication is rewritten, not written (Few, 2012).</p>
                    
                    <p>Looking forward, I'll apply these lessons to all my statistical presentations. Whether creating visualizations for academic papers, business reports, or AI model performance summaries, I now understand that my responsibility extends beyond accurate calculation to clear communication. The goal isn't just to present data correctly, but to present it in ways that drive understanding and action.</p>
