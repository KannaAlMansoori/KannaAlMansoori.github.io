                    </header>

          <!-- Question 1 -->
<div class="box">
    <h3>Question 1: Primary Purpose and Differences</h3>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the primary purpose of descriptive statistics, and how does it differ from other statistical methods?</p>
    
    <h4>My Answer:</h4>
    <p>Descriptive statistics organizes and summarizes data to make it easier to understand. According to Dong (2023), it converts scattered observations into meaningful summaries like means, medians, and standard deviations. Unlike inferential statistics, which makes predictions about larger populations, descriptive statistics simply describes what's actually in your dataset—it's the foundation for more complex analyses.</p>
</div>
                  <!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="box">
    <h3>Question 2: Beijing Housing Prices - Key Factors (Table 2)</h3>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> According to the paper's analysis of housing prices in Beijing (Table 2), what were the key factors that contributed to the increase in housing prices between 2012 and 2015? Explain how the descriptive statistics helped identify these factors.</p>
    
    <h4>My Answer:</h4>
    <p>According to Table 2, the key factors contributing to Beijing's housing price increase from 2012 to 2015 were property size characteristics: living space grew from 102.52 to 123.94 square meters, average bedrooms increased from 2.126 to 2.415, and building height rose from 14.099 to 15.342 floors. These changes aligned with the overall price jump from 336.727 to 477.521.</p>
    
    <p>Descriptive statistics helped identify these factors by enabling year-to-year comparisons through means and standard deviations. This made it easy to spot which characteristics changed significantly alongside prices. Importantly, the statistics also showed that orientation remained stable, indicating it wasn't a contributing factor—demonstrating how descriptive statistics can both confirm and eliminate potential explanatory variables.</p>
</div>

                  <!-- Question 3 -->
<div class="box">
    <h3>Question 3: Mean, Median, and Mode - Calculation</h3>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the difference between mean, median, and mode. Given the sample: 13, 15, 17, 15, 20, 15, 18, calculate all three measures of central tendency.</p>
    
    <h4>My Answer:</h4>
    <p>The three measures of central tendency differ in how they represent typical values: the <strong>mean</strong> is the arithmetic average (sum ÷ count), the <strong>median</strong> is the middle value when data is ordered, and the <strong>mode</strong> is the most frequently occurring value.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Calculations for the sample:</strong><br>
    Given: 13, 15, 17, 15, 20, 15, 18<br>
    Ordered: 13, 15, 15, 15, 17, 18, 20</p>
    
    <p>
    <strong>Mean</strong> = (13 + 15 + 17 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 18) ÷ 7 = 113 ÷ 7 = <strong>16.14</strong><br>
    <strong>Median</strong> = Middle value (4th position) = <strong>15</strong><br>
    <strong>Mode</strong> = Most frequent value (appears 3 times) = <strong>15</strong>
    </p>
</div>

               <!-- Question 4 -->
<div class="box">
    <h3>Question 4: Main Limitations</h3>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the main limitations of descriptive statistics as identified in the paper? Why is descriptive statistics alone not sufficient for comprehensive statistical analysis?</p>
    
    <h4>My Answer:</h4>
    <p>According to Dong (2023), descriptive statistics has three main limitations. First, it cannot predict future trends—it only describes existing data and compares what already exists, without forecasting capabilities. Second, data collection can be time-intensive, as demonstrated by the stock market example where gathering comprehensive data took researchers months. Third, and most importantly, descriptive statistics alone is insufficient because it summarizes data without explaining causation or relationships between variables.</p>
    
    <p>This is why descriptive statistics serves as a starting point rather than a complete solution. It provides the foundation for analysis but must be combined with inferential statistics or regression models for comprehensive understanding.</p>
</div>
                    

                    <!-- Question 5 -->
                <div class="box">
    <h3>Question 5: Stock Market and Trust Relationship (Tables 3 & 4)</h3>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Based on Table 3 and Table 4 in the stock market analysis section, explain how descriptive statistics (particularly mean values) helped researchers determine the relationship between trust levels and stock market volatility during COVID-19.</p>
    
    <h4>My Answer:</h4>
    <p>Descriptive statistics revealed the trust-volatility relationship through systematic comparison of mean values. Table 3 established baseline measures for social trust, government trust, and market volatility. Table 4 then split countries by trust level, showing high-trust countries had a case growth rate of 0.0420 compared to 0.0674 for low-trust countries.</p>
    
    <p>This comparison clearly demonstrated that lower trust levels correlated with higher case growth rates and greater stock market volatility during COVID-19. By calculating simple means, researchers transformed thousands of observations into comparable numbers that revealed how high-trust countries maintained more stable markets during the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>
                    <p><em>Summary of findings from the COVID-19 dataset activity:</em></p>

                    <h4>1. Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Confirmed Indian Nationals:</strong> Mean = 5.55, Median = 3.00, SD = 8.34, Variance = 69.55, Range: 0–60</li>
                        <li><strong>Confirmed Foreign Nationals:</strong> Mean = 1.33, Median = 0.00, SD = 3.59, Variance = 12.87, Range: 0–14</li>
                        <li><strong>Cured Cases:</strong> Mean = 0.60, Median = 0.00, SD = 1.46, Variance = 2.14, Range: 0–9</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Distribution Patterns Identified:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All variables showed strong right-skewed distributions with most values near zero.</li>
                        <li>Confirmed Indian Nationals had the highest variability (SD = 8.34).</li>
                        <li>Foreign Nationals, Cured, and Deaths were mostly zero with occasional spikes.</li>
                        <li>Median values of zero indicate that most observations had no cases.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3. Outliers Detected:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Indian Nationals:</strong> Outliers above 20 cases, maximum of 60.</li>
                        <li><strong>Foreign Nationals:</strong> Outliers beyond 5 cases, reaching 14.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cured Cases:</strong> Outliers above 3 cases.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deaths:</strong> Maximum value observed was 1.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>4. Key Insights from Visualizations:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Histograms showed heavy concentration near zero with long right tails.</li>
                        <li>Violin plots highlighted wide bases with thin upper extensions.</li>
                        <li>Boxplots clearly identified outlier states/days with unusually high case counts.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>5. Overall Interpretation:</h4>
                    <p>During January–March 2020, COVID-19 cases in India were unevenly distributed, with most states reporting minimal or zero cases and a small number of hotspots driving the overall statistics. This reflects an early-stage epidemic pattern prior to widespread transmission, with low recovery and death counts consistent with limited infection spread.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This assignment strengthened my understanding of descriptive statistics and their practical application in real-world data analysis. The seminar materials and Dong (2023) demonstrated how these methods are used across different domains, from housing markets to pandemic responses.</p>
        
        <p>A key insight was recognizing that while descriptive statistics effectively summarize data, they cannot explain underlying causes or relationships. This limitation highlights the importance of combining descriptive methods with inferential statistics for comprehensive analysis.</p>
        
        <p>Working through the calculations manually reinforced my grasp of fundamental concepts like mean, median, and mode. The Beijing housing price analysis demonstrated how descriptive statistics can systematically identify contributing factors through year-to-year comparisons, while the COVID-19 trust study showed how simple mean comparisons can reveal complex relationships between variables.</p>
        
        <p>Applying these concepts to the COVID-19 India dataset through R—performing calculations and creating visualizations—helped bridge theory and practice, strengthening both my analytical skills and ability to interpret data meaningfully.</p>
