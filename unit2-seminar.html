                    <!-- Question 1 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Question 1: Primary Purpose and Differences</h3>
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the primary purpose of descriptive statistics, and how does it differ from other statistical methods?</p>
                        
                        <h4>My Answer:</h4>
                        <p>The primary purpose of descriptive statistics is to organize and summarize data so it's easier to understand. According to Dong (2023), it helps researchers manage the natural variability in data by converting scattered observations into meaningful summaries like means, medians, and standard deviations.</p>
                        
                        <p>The key difference from other statistical methods is that descriptive statistics only describes what exists in your data - it doesn't make predictions or inferences about larger populations. While inferential statistics tries to generalize findings beyond your sample, descriptive statistics stays focused on summarizing the actual data you have. It's essentially a foundation that other, more complex analyses can build upon.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Question 2 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Question 2: Beijing Housing Prices - Key Factors (Table 2)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> According to the paper's analysis of housing prices in Beijing (Table 2), what were the key factors that contributed to the increase in housing prices between 2012 and 2015? Explain how the descriptive statistics helped identify these factors.</p>
                        
                        <h4>My Answer:</h4>
                        <p>The descriptive statistics in Table 2 revealed several key factors driving Beijing's housing price increases from 2012 to 2015:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Main contributing factors:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Living space increased from 102.52 to 123.94 square meters</li>
                            <li>Bedrooms rose from 2.126 to 2.415 average</li>
                            <li>Building height (floor number) increased from 14.099 to 15.342</li>
                            <li>Overall price jumped from 336.727 to 477.521</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The descriptive statistics helped by allowing direct year-to-year comparisons. By calculating means and standard deviations for each variable, researchers could quickly identify which characteristics changed significantly alongside prices.</p>
                        
                        <p>Importantly, the statistics also showed that orientation (North, South, East, West) remained relatively stable, proving it wasn't a price determinant. This demonstrates how descriptive statistics can both confirm and eliminate potential explanatory factors.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Question 3 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Question 3: Mean, Median, and Mode - Calculation</h3>
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the difference between mean, median, and mode. Given the sample: 13, 15, 17, 15, 20, 15, 18, calculate all three measures of central tendency.</p>
                        
                        <h4>My Answer:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The arithmetic average (sum of all values ÷ number of values)</li>
                            <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when data is arranged in order</li>
                            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequently occurring value</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Calculations:</strong></p>
                        <p>Given sample: 13, 15, 17, 15, 20, 15, 18</p>
                        <p>Ordered: 13, 15, 15, 15, 17, 18, 20</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Mean</strong> = (13 + 15 + 17 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 18) ÷ 7 = 113 ÷ 7 = <strong>16.14</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Median</strong> = Middle value (4th position in 7 values) = <strong>15</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Mode</strong> = Most frequent value (15 appears 3 times) = <strong>15</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Question 4 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Question 4: Main Limitations</h3>
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the main limitations of descriptive statistics as identified in the paper? Why is descriptive statistics alone not sufficient for comprehensive statistical analysis?</p>
                        
                        <h4>My Answer:</h4>
                        <p>Dong (2023) identifies three critical limitations:</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Cannot predict future trends</strong> - Descriptive statistics only describes existing data. It can't forecast future values or identify trends over time, only compare what already exists.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Time-intensive data collection</strong> - As shown in the stock market example, gathering comprehensive data from multiple sources took researchers months of work.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Insufficient alone</strong> - The paper emphasizes that descriptive statistics needs to be combined with inferential statistics or regression models for comprehensive analysis. It summarizes data but doesn't explain causation or relationships.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>These limitations explain why researchers use descriptive statistics as a starting point rather than a complete solution. It provides the foundation, but deeper analysis requires additional statistical methods.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Question 5 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>Question 5: Stock Market and Trust Relationship (Tables 3 & 4)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Based on Table 3 and Table 4 in the stock market analysis section, explain how descriptive statistics (particularly mean values) helped researchers determine the relationship between trust levels and stock market volatility during COVID-19.</p>
                        
                        <h4>My Answer:</h4>
                        <p>The descriptive statistics, particularly mean values, revealed the trust-volatility relationship through comparison:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Table 3 established baseline means:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Social trust: mean = 31.09</li>
                            <li>Government trust: mean = 39.31</li>
                            <li>Overall market volatility: mean = 0.0178</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Table 4 split countries by trust level and compared means:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High trust countries: case growth rate = 0.0420</li>
                            <li>Low trust countries: case growth rate = 0.0674</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The key finding emerged from comparing these means: countries with lower trust levels had higher case growth rates (0.0674 vs 0.0420), indicating greater stock market volatility during COVID-19.</p>
                        
                        <p>By calculating and comparing simple mean values, researchers could identify a pattern across thousands of observations - high-trust countries experienced more stable markets during the pandemic. The descriptive statistics simplified complex data into comparable numbers that clearly demonstrated the relationship between trust levels and market stability.</p>

                    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
<p><em>Summary of findings from the COVID-19 dataset activity:</em></p>

<h4>1. Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Confirmed Indian Nationals:</strong> Mean = 5.55, Median = 3.00, SD = 8.34, Variance = 69.55, Range: 0-60</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed Foreign Nationals:</strong> Mean = 1.33, Median = 0.00, SD = 3.59, Variance = 12.87, Range: 0-14</li>
    <li><strong>Cured Cases:</strong> Mean = 0.60, Median = 0.00, SD = 1.46, Variance = 2.14, Range: 0-9</li>
    <li><strong>Deaths:</strong> Mean = 0.09, Median = 0.00, SD = 0.29, Variance = 0.08, Range: 0-1</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Distribution Patterns Identified:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>All variables showed <strong>strong right-skewed distributions</strong> with most values concentrated near zero</li>
    <li>Indian Nationals had the widest spread with significant variability (SD = 8.34)</li>
    <li>Foreign Nationals, Cured, and Deaths were predominantly zero with occasional spikes</li>
    <li>Median values of zero for three variables indicate that most observations had no cases</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Outliers Detected:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Indian Nationals:</strong> Multiple outliers above 20 cases, maximum reaching 60</li>
    <li><strong>Foreign Nationals:</strong> Outliers present beyond 5 cases, extending to 14</li>
    <li><strong>Cured Cases:</strong> Outliers detected above 3 cases</li>
    <li><strong>Deaths:</strong> Maximum value of 1 represented the upper limit</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Key Insights from Visualizations:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Histograms</strong> revealed the extreme concentration of data near zero with long right tails, confirming the early-stage pandemic characteristics</li>
    <li><strong>Violin plots</strong> clearly illustrated the distribution shapes: wide bases (high frequency of low values) with thin extensions (rare high values)</li>
    <li><strong>Boxplots</strong> effectively identified outlier states/days that experienced significantly higher case numbers compared to the majority</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Overall Interpretation:</h4>
<p>The analysis reveals that during January-March 2020, COVID-19 spread in India was highly uneven and concentrated. Most states reported minimal or zero cases across all categories, while a few hotspots drove the overall statistics. This pattern is typical of early-stage epidemic spread before widespread community transmission. The low recovery and death numbers reflect both the early pandemic phase and the limited scale of infections during this period.</p>

                    <p>This seminar preparation deepened my understanding of descriptive statistics as a foundational tool in data analysis. Reading the Dong (2023) paper highlighted the practical applications of descriptive statistics across different domains, from housing markets to pandemic-related stock volatility.</p>
                    
                    <p>The most valuable insight was understanding the limitations of descriptive statistics. While it excels at summarizing and organizing data, it cannot make predictions or establish causation. This realization emphasized the importance of combining descriptive methods with inferential statistics for comprehensive analysis.</p>
                    
                    <p>Working through the calculations manually (mean, median, mode) reinforced my understanding of these fundamental concepts. The Beijing housing price analysis demonstrated how descriptive statistics can systematically identify contributing factors through year-to-year comparisons, while the COVID-19 trust study showed how simple mean comparisons can reveal complex relationships.</p>
                    
                    <p>The dataset activity challenged me to apply these concepts practically, creating various visualizations to explore the COVID-19 India dataset. This hands-on experience reinforced the theory covered in the seminar questions and improved my R programming skills for statistical analysis.</p>
