                    <!-- Question 1 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>1. What is a probability distribution?</h3>
                        <p>A probability distribution is essentially a mathematical function that shows all the possible values a variable can take and how likely each value is to occur. Think of it as a map that tells us the chances of different outcomes happening.</p>
                        <p>For example, when we flip a coin, the probability distribution would show that heads has a 50% chance and tails has a 50% chance. In more complex situations, like measuring people's heights or test scores, the distribution helps us understand patterns in the data and make predictions about future observations.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Question 2 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>2. What are the different types of distribution?</h3>
                        <p>There are several key types of distributions, each suited for different kinds of data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Normal Distribution (Gaussian):</strong> The classic bell-shaped curve. Most natural phenomena like heights, weights, and test scores follow this pattern. Data clusters around the mean with values tapering off symmetrically on both sides.</li>
                            <li><strong>Binomial Distribution:</strong> Used when we have a fixed number of yes/no trials, like counting how many heads appear in 10 coin flips.</li>
                            <li><strong>Poisson Distribution:</strong> Useful for counting events that happen over time or space, such as the number of customer arrivals per hour or emails received per day.</li>
                            <li><strong>Uniform Distribution:</strong> All outcomes have equal probability, like rolling a fair die where each number has a 1/6 chance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exponential Distribution:</strong> Often used to model waiting times, like how long until the next customer arrives or how long a machine part lasts before failing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Question 3 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>3. What are quantiles and how do they divide data?</h3>
                        <p>Quantiles are cutoff points that divide our data into equal-sized groups. They help us understand how data is spread out across the range.</p>
                        <p><strong>Common types include:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Quartiles:</strong> Divide data into 4 equal parts (25% each). The first quartile (Q1) marks the 25th percentile, the second quartile (Q2) is the median at 50%, and the third quartile (Q3) is at the 75th percentile.</li>
                            <li><strong>Percentiles:</strong> Divide data into 100 equal parts. For example, scoring in the 90th percentile means you performed better than 90% of others.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deciles:</strong> Divide data into 10 equal parts (10% each).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Quantiles are particularly useful because they're not affected by extreme values, making them reliable for understanding the overall distribution of data even when outliers are present.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Question 4 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>4. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?</h3>
                        <p>The Central Limit Theorem is one of the most important concepts in statistics. It states that when we take repeated samples from any population and calculate their means, those sample means will form a normal distribution, regardless of the original population's distribution—as long as the sample size is large enough (typically n ≥ 30).</p>
                        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> This theorem is powerful because it allows us to make inferences about populations even when we don't know their exact distribution. It's the foundation for many statistical tests and confidence intervals. For example, if we're studying average income in a city, we can take multiple samples, and the CLT assures us that the distribution of those sample means will be normal, making our analysis and predictions more reliable.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Question 5 -->
                    <div class="box">
                        <h3>5. What is the difference between Type I and Type II errors?</h3>
                        <p>These are the two types of mistakes we can make when testing hypotheses:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Type I Error (False Positive):</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This happens when we reject a true null hypothesis—essentially, we conclude something is happening when it actually isn't.</li>
                            <li>Example: A medical test says you have a disease when you're actually healthy.</li>
                            <li>The probability of making this error is denoted by α (alpha), often set at 0.05 or 5%.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Type II Error (False Negative):</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis—we miss detecting something that's actually there.</li>
                            <li>Example: A medical test says you're healthy when you actually have the disease.</li>
                            <li>The probability of this error is denoted by β (beta).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>The Trade-off:</strong> Unfortunately, reducing one type of error often increases the other. In practice, we need to decide which error is more critical to avoid based on the context. For medical diagnoses, we might prefer Type I errors (false alarms) over Type II errors (missed diagnoses), as it's safer to do additional testing than to miss a real condition.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>This seminar deepened my understanding of how probability underpins statistical analysis. The concept that struck me most was the Central Limit Theorem—it's fascinating how such a powerful tool allows us to work with samples and make reliable inferences about entire populations.</p>
                    <p>Learning about Type I and Type II errors also gave me a more practical perspective on hypothesis testing. In real-world applications, especially in fields like healthcare or AI model validation, understanding these errors helps us make more thoughtful decisions about acceptable risk levels.</p>
                    <p>Moving forward, I feel better equipped to choose appropriate probability distributions for different datasets and to interpret statistical results with greater confidence and awareness of potential errors.</p>
